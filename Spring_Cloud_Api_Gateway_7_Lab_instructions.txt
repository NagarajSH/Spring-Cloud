1)Create a spring starter project with dependencies web, thymeleaf,config,eureka and zuul.
2)copy the css,js and html present in the service-gateway project to the respective directories
3)open the main application class and add the annotation @EnableZuulProxy
4)you can access the url : localhost:8080/*, where * represents service-noun,service-subject etc.
5)The url localhost:8080/ opens the sentence.html thymeleaf page with a random sentence for every refresh.

Etag support
------------
1)Open the main application class and add the below bean.

	@Bean
	public Filter shallowEtagHeaderFilter() {
	    return new ShallowEtagHeaderFilter();
	}

2)Now access the url: localhost:8080/ and observe the network tab in the debugger. you can see some calls returned with 304. 

why only some calls 304?
Ans: Because words returning by the backend service are random, the one's which return the same value again comeback with 304.
