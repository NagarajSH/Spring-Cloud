1)Get rabbitmq installer for windows and install it.
2)Add spring-cloud-starter-bus-amqp and actuator dependencies in config-server and also in all microservices.
3)Move all the microservices words property into git. Make sure that name of the file matches the pattern {spring.application.name}-{profile}.properties. For ex, service-noun-primary.properties
4)All the properties name should be prefixed with some string. For ex: noun.words=bat,book
5)In the controller classes of all microservices, add the classlevel annotation @ConfigurationProperties. For ex:  @ConfigurationProperties(prefix="adjective")
Note: That prefix should match the one defined in step 4.
6)Add setters and getters for the property "words" in all controller classes.
7)Start config server, discovery server, micro services and test the service-sentence.
8)Modify some or all the properties in git, and make a post request to the uri /bus/refresh of config-server.
9)test the service-sentence again to test if the changes are reflected.
